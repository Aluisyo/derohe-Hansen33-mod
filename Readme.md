### Dev Fees

 Integrator Rewards are split 50/50 to Node Owner and Development Team.
 It does this by rotating the node integrator address after each IB rewards.
 Owner integrator address is always paid first, then dev, then owner, then dev and so forth.
 Only nodes used for mining will pay development fees.
 Avoid fees by modifying the source code or restart node every time you make a IB reward.
